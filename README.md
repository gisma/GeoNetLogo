# Geography as a spatial interpretation of the world

## Course objectives

In this exercise the following contents are to be worked out:
* The ability to understand, apply and interpret geographical modelling
* The ability to observe spatio-temporally and to simplify these observations to form general statements
* The integration of research results into one's own observation and abstraction management 
* The ability to map this abstraction with a suitable software tool


## From idea to model
The derivation of scientific concepts or general ideas into an appropriate model structure is a complex process that cannot be learned schematically. The interrelationships of the real world are usually so complex that they can only be presented or analysed in a generalised form in a comprehensible way. Already in everyday life we continuously construct so-called mental or cognitive models to simplify our perception of the world (Rasch 2006). This fact is also known in the sciences. For example, the physicist Bridgman noted in 1927: " believe that the model is a useful and indeed unescapable tool of thought, in that it enables us to think about the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar" (Bridgman 1927), while in 1972 the modeller Rivet simply claimed: "The History of mankind is the history of model building. (Rivett 1972).

The perception and interpretation of the "real world" and the development of suitable strategies for dealing with this world in a practical way is done with the aid of abstraction and communication ( = model building). The strategies of abstraction are conflicting and diverse, since contextual dependency and the objective of the abstracting person exert a significant influence on the results ("Methode Götterblick" see also Eckmüllner 2007). This means that the chosen abstraction of the (spatial) world is, from a scientific point of view, at best comprehensible and transparent but never true. Also the logical validity of the abstraction does not guarantee the validity of derived or general statements. Whether the constructed model corresponds to reality, i.e. is correct, can therefore not be proven. At best, validity for the defined purpose can be proven, but never truth (Bossel 2004).
In principle, one can distinguish between learning and implementing tools for implementing model concepts in bottom up and top down approaches. A bottom up approach can be described as the step-by-step learning of the modeling language (in this course Netlogo) by implementing conceptual modeling ideas (e.g. positive or negative feedback schemes etc.). This approach has the advantage of providing elementary building blocks step by step in order to create and understand more complex models. It is comparable to the conventional approach of learning a foreign language by systematically learning vocabulary and grammar.

The opposite way top down, however, is more like "jump in the cold water and swim (or go under)" or, to stay with the example above, learning a foreign language by speaking and interacting in this language from the beginning.
Both concepts have didactic and pragmatic advantages and disadvantages. In our case, the attempt to start with an existing, rather complex model is based on the experience that the bottom-up approach requires a disproportionate amount of time to understand and develop models that are interesting in terms of content.
For geographic teaching practice, a combined bottom up and top down approach seems to me to be a suitable way to efficiently acquire both content and technical skills. Therefore, the bottom up approach is intensively pursued in the second part of the exercise.
